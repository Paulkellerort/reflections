1.  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository is essential for collaborating on team projects, so that many different members
can keep track of all the changes that are being made.  It could also be useful even if I am working on a solo project
if I am using public computers, because I can just keep all my progress stored on the remote repository instead
of saving locally.  The remote repository will also serve as an accessible historical record of my work to easily
display to others.
